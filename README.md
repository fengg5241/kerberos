1 what i have achieved / delivered last one year.
A Designed and developed ITT. Apart from implementing requirements from user, also considering how to improve application performance and better user experience even though some of them not clearly mentioned in the requirements. 
For example:
1) Minify the application code to improve speed of loading application.
2) Providing one-click function to copy email template from web UI so that user just focus on the business , don't worry about which content should copy or miss something .
3) Providing highlight current related ITT event in the event list based on user seleted cargo. Actually user don't require this feature, but it is very diffcult to find related event if there are so many events and cargos.That is why we add this founction.

B Delivery ITT. All deliveries are followed by the schedule, never be late. And keep application good qulity.  

C After ITT go live, start to work on the CIS project as backend developer.

2 The ablities are proved.
A Fullstack and Devops. Even though the title is senior Angular developer, sounds like front developer. But after ITT go live, most of time work as backend developer and work with operations teams as well such as OVD tech team and Web Project team.
B Fast learning. Spent a few days to learn React and Redux and did a poc demo, and share knowledge to whole team members.The important thing is got the good feedback from team members. They said  have ability to write simple code by React syntax after this sharing.
C Cross Project and Muiti-thread. Can work multi-project at the same time and arrage schedule based on priority to finish all the task properly 
D Sense of responsibility and passion. Always say "OK", "i can do" for all the task assigned to me. Like to challenge myself
